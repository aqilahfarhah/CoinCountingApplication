# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware, our group uses the laptop which consists of intel core i5 and 8GB RAM to conduct our project for image processing related tasks and the raw images is taken using a smartphone's camera, a tripod with a image background setting(black).

#### Software Requirement:
For the software, our group used iamge processing library in MATLAB to carry out image processing tasks. The language that will be used is python for counting the coins

#### Outcomes of the system
2 main steps will be applied in our system, which is labelling the coin and calculation. Given an input image, the first step is to label the coins, detect them as different objects and then calculation based on the value set on each range of size.
