# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
In order to use vending machine to buy food or drinks, people must use coins to purchase it. It might take some time for customer to count their coins and purchase it. If they are many customers who want to use vending and all of them need to calculate their coins, it will wasted their time. In addition, some irresponsibility people that manipulate the vending machine by using the fake coins like slug.

In our coin counting system, a camera will be positioned inside the vending machine. Then, customer just have to put all their coins without count it in the space provided and the vending will count their coins and list down all the food or drink that available according to that total. In this project, we will focus on coin counting using image processing, not to apply the vending machine itself. We will contribute with vending machine company to apply our application. This will save customerâ€™s time to purchase and avoid fake coins to be accepted. This is the very first step in developing coin counting application in Vending Machine
