## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt chart used to illustrate and document the project management life cycle enables the CloudRevel employees to occasionally adhere to the rules and reach the milestones. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's duties and work into a number of modules, including the project, procurement, and risk manager. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own roles and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:
